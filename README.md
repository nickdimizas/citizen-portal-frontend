### **Overview**

This is the **frontend** for the Citizen Portal. It provides the user interface for citizens and administrators to interact with the backend services.

Key technologies used:

- **React + TypeScript** for building the UI
- **Vite** for fast development and build tooling
- **Material UI (MUI)** for styling and UI components

The frontend communicates with the [Citizen Portal Backend](https://github.com/nickdimizas/citizen-portal-backend.git) for authentication, user management, and data services.

### **Prerequisites**

- **Node.js**: Version 20.x (LTS) or 22.x (Current) recommended
